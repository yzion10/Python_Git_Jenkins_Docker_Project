clean_environment.py - This file stop flask servers (localhost) from rest_app.py file.
it protected with error handling in case servers are not responding

templates - contains html file for render_template in rest_app.py

Dockerfile - An image will be built based on what we defined in the Dockerfile

docker-compose.yml - this file will run the container based on what we defined in the docker-compose.yml

docker_backend_testing.py - test the flask server (rest_app.py) that running inside the container.
the test will running outside the container and will try to send/get/put/delete resuests to the flask that is inside the container.

requirements.txt - A file wich include the requirements to install before executing *.py files

jenkinsfile - A jenkins pipeline script (in groovy) which connect to git repository and execute the following steps:
1. Checkout Git Repo holding this project
2. Run rest_app.py - start a flask server locally
3. Run backend_testing.py - test flask server locally
4. Run clean_environment.py - down flask server locally
5. Build docker Image locally
6. Push the docker Image To DockerHub
7. Set compose image version â€“ setting the version inside the .env file for docker-compose (according the pipeline build number)
8. Run docker compose - will run in detach mode (run the container based on what we defined in the docker-compose.yml)
9. Test dockerized app - will run the docker_backend_testing.py
10. Clean container - will call docker-compose down and delete local image
